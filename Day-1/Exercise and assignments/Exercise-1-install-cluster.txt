Exercise -1

1) Clone the git repository from https://github.com/ganeshhp/training-documents.git

2) Move into the git repository and open the file install-kube-cp.sh file in editor.

3) Understand the shell script steps. and run the shell script. Make sure the script is in executable form.

4) $ sudo chmod +x install-kube-cp.sh

5) ./install-kube-cp.sh 

6) The script will install all required services like, containerd, kubelet and binaries like, kubectl and kubeadm on the control-plane server. This will also initialize the kubernetes cluster and install the required calico network interface.
Follow all steps as prompted during the script installation.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## we are running this cluster as a Single Node cluster so we will have to make certain changes to the Node role.

## Once installation process complete after successful script execution, check status using below commands.

$ kubectl get nodes 
## above command shows status of clustered node. Note if the node shows the status as ready.

## now we want to run a POD and see if the Node is able to schedule the POD.

$ kubectl run testpod --image=ubuntu:latest

$ kubectl get pods

## see if the status of the POD is running. If not then we will have to change the Node status. So that we allow the control-plane Node to run the Work Load.

## run below command to add the role of the control-plane server with Worker Node role as well.

$ kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-

## check the status of the POD one more time and validate if it shows it as running.
