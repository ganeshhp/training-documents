### Creating Branches

## How to list current branches.

$ git branch

## How to create a new branch, name the branch as 'development'

$ git branch development

## List the branches again

$ git branch

### How to switch to the new branch

$ git checkout / switch development

### run 'git branch' command and note which branch is active.
### move into the .git/refs folder and note the folder / file created there.
### run the tree command to view how folder and files are referred.

## add a new file and commit the file to the branch.
$ git add file2.txt
$ git commit -m "new file added to development branch"

## switch to master / main branch.

$ git switch master

## merge development hash objects to main/master.

$ git merge development

## note the fast-forward merge.

### Follow below steps to check how Recursive Merge process works.
## Make changes to the file again while inside the master branch and commit the changes to master branch.

$ nano file2.txt

$ git add file2.txt

$ git commit -m "file.txt updated and added to master branch"

## now switch to master branch again and update the file2.txt file with different changes than the one done in master branch.

## add and commit the file2.txt changes to development branch

$ git add file2.txt
$ git commit -m "file2.txt updated and added to development branch"

## now move to master branch again and merge the development branch to master.

$ git switch master
$ git merge development

## note the recursive merge.
